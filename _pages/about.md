About me
Hi there! As an astrophysicist, my work revolves around studying gravitational waves and pulsars. Specifically, I focus on Nano and Hecto hertz Gravitational Wave (GW) astronomy using Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTA) and Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) respectively. My research centers on identifying astrophysical sources of gravitational waves, GW data analysis, and developing software packages that will be useful to search for some special classes of events in GW data.

I did my Masters in Astrophyics at St. Xavier's college, Mumbai. Currently, I am a Physics lecturer at Rizvi College of Engineering, Mumbai.

I am also a member of the Indian Pulsar Timing Array, LIGO Scientific Collaboration, and the International Pulsar Timing Array consortium.
